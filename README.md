✅ Activity B (i) – Full Checklist (T Level OS)

(Visual / Interface Designs + Algorithms)

✔ 1. Visual / Interface Designs Checklist
User Interface Designs

You must produce screens/wireframes for each page of your system.

✔ Create a UI design for every required screen
✔ Include a clear user journey (how users move from one screen to the next)

Colour / Typography Justification

✔ Explain why you chose:
– Colours
– Font sizes
– Layout choices
(Accessibility + W3C reasons)

Follow W3C Guidelines (from Task 1 requirements)

✔ Alt text for images
✔ High contrast options
✔ Logical reading order
✔ Keyboard navigation considerations
✔ Scalable fonts
✔ Consistent layout conventions
(These match the Distinction examples shown in the examiner report

)

Front-End Requirements

✔ Pages needed
✔ Buttons / links
✔ Forms
✔ Input validation
✔ Navigation bar behaviour
✔ Mobile responsive layout
✔ Media used (images, icons, videos)

Back-End Requirements

✔ Server processes
✔ Database operations required
✔ Login / authentication
✔ Booking logic
✔ Data validation rules
✔ API endpoints if applicable
✔ Error handling
✔ Security controls (password hashing, HTTPS etc.)

Security Evaluation (high-level)

✔ State who performs security controls (developers, admins — not “how to code it”)
✔ General security processes:
– Encryption
– Validation
– Sanitisation
– Permission checks
– Preventing SQL injection
– Protecting user data
(Matches security expectations in mark scheme Task 1

)

✔ 2. Algorithm Checklist

You must include algorithms in pseudocode or flowcharts.

The instructions require algorithms for:

Login Algorithm

✔ Inputs needed (username + password)
✔ Check account exists
✔ Validate credentials
✔ Handle errors (incorrect password, blank input, etc.)
✔ Output = login success or failure
✔ Justification (why it works this way)

Registering a New User Algorithm

✔ Inputs: name, email, username, password
✔ Validate each field
✔ Hash password
✔ Check if username/email exists already
✔ Store user in DB
✔ Output success message
✔ Justify the steps

Booking an Order Algorithm (Ticket or Hotel)

✔ Input: date, number of guests / rooms
✔ Check availability
✔ Calculate price
✔ Apply loyalty points (if relevant)
✔ Save booking
✔ Return confirmation or error
✔ Provide a justification

(Matches OS Task 1 expectation for decomposition + flowcharts like those shown in Distinction examples on pages 12–13 

le-report-occupational-speciali…

)

✔ Algorithm Justification

For EACH algorithm, you must justify:

✔ Why your structure was chosen
✔ How it solves the functional requirement
✔ How errors are handled
✔ How input → process → output is managed
✔ Why the algorithm is efficient
(Directly required in your screenshot.)

✔ Optional Error Tables (If Needed)

Include a table listing:

✔ Error description
✔ Cause
✔ How your system handles it
✔ Expected outcome

This matches the mark scheme for handling errors/validation in design requirements (Task 1 Activity B – Data Requirements)

.

✔ Data Table Requirements

Create a data table showing:

✔ Name of each data item
✔ Function / purpose
✔ Data type
✔ Reason for including it

(Matches expectations on data requirements in Task 1 B Design section: variables, data types, structures, consistency, validation rules

.)

✔ Data Model Diagrams

Include 3 diagrams:

1. Conceptual Model

✔ Entities only (e.g., Users, Bookings, Rooms)

2. Logical Model

✔ Entities + Attributes
✔ Relationships
✔ Cardinality (1–many etc.)

3. Physical Model

✔ Exact table structures
✔ Data types
✔ Primary / foreign keys

(Matches data requirement guidance from the design section of Task 1 

digital-occupational-specialism…

)

✔ Testing Plan for the System

Explain how you will test the solution:

✔ Testing type
✔ Who is testing
✔ What data is used
✔ When it happens
✔ The expected outcome

This matches the expectations from the Test Strategy template (Task1_Test_Strategy_Template.doc) 

Task1_Test_Strategy_Template

.

✔ Final Submission Must Include
For Visual / Interface Designs

✔ All UI Screens
✔ Navigation flow / user journey
✔ Colour + typography justification
✔ W3C Compliance notes
✔ Front-end requirements
✔ Back-end requirements
✔ Security evaluation

For Algorithms

✔ Login algorithm
✔ Register user algorithm
✔ Booking algorithm
✔ Extra algorithms if needed
✔ Full justifications
✔ Error-handling explanation
✔ Data table
✔ Conceptual + Logical + Physical data models
✔ Testing explanation
